# Content Management System - CP3402 - Week 2 - Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
 - This week I learned to create a website using Joomla. The website content is based on the previous one I created in week 1. To complete this practical,
   I focused on some online resources such as articles and videos from youtube, which also help me build a solid foundation and preparations for assignment 1.

## Estimated Hours
For this week's practical, I spent approximately 24 hours on learning and creating the website by using Joomla.

## Content Insights

This time I created a website that is based on the previous website but with a few differences. I noticed that the bakery shops should not only be focusing on 
the youth but also on the old-aged audience. Thus, I expanded the menu options by adding super healthy bakery products and beverages for the senior audiences, 
increasing the bakery market from young adults to seniors.

Throughout this journey, I found some difficulties in utilizing Joomla at first but got them all solved after watching the videos and reading the articles on 
the web. I uploaded some images to make the website more user-friendly. For this website, I applied the template named "Cassiopeia" and edited it. The template 
definitely shortens my time in creating a new one.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

The conclusion of this week is that I learned a new way to create websites besides using GitHub and WordPress. 
I discovered that sometimes watching videos takes a long time. So instead of watching, I read the articles which 
is much faster. My experience utilizing Joomla gave me a deep insight into exploring a new tool to create a website.
