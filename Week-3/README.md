# Content Management System - CP3402 - Week 3 - Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
 - For this week's practical, I created a website using the CMS platform called WordPress through Infinity Free. I reused the content and goals from the website I made last week. My focus was on learning how to effectively utilize WordPress, a skill that I believe will greatly help me in both individual and group assignments.

## Estimated Hours
I spent a total of 24 hours learning and developing the WordPress website.

## Content Insights
I reused all the content from the website I created last week and developed it further using WordPress. I added new elements like a call-to-action button and a contact form, allowing customers to click the button, which directs them to the contact page where they can fill out the form to get in touch.

During this journey, I encountered confusion in the initial stages of creating the website using WordPress. My understanding of WordPress improved significantly after watching tutorial videos on YouTube. I discovered the HTML code for the contact form and successfully applied it to my contact page, allowing customers to fill in their information and reach out to us. I chose the 'twenty seventeen' theme, which I found suitable for my website, I followed a step-by-step video on customizing it. This not only saved my time but also deepened my understanding of utilizing WordPress.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week, I acquired valuable insights into learning a new CMS platform, WordPress, for website development, in addition to platforms like GitHub and Joomla. I found that watching short tutorial videos and immediately applying the practical aspects helped me gain a deeper understanding of the content. Working with WordPress provided me with profound insights into its effective utilization for website development.

In comparing Joomla and WordPress, I discovered that WordPress is more flexible, offering a broader range of theme options. As a result, it has become my preferred choice for website development.

## Group Formation
This week, I conducted interviews with my fellow peers to select the right members for my upcoming assignments. After interviewing each peer and carefully considering their responses, I chose three individuals to form a group. I chose them for several reasons: we share similar concepts and ideas, we are on the same page, and they demonstrate a strong sense of responsibility, ensuring active participation. Additionally, they are open to feedback and willing to make improvements based on it. The chosen teammates are:

 1. Adrianto Hartono
 2. Joseph Paolo Tan
 3. James Wongsonegoro
