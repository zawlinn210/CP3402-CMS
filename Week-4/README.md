# Content Management System - CP3402 - Week 4 - Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
 - For this practical, we had to install WordPress on our device and create a local host website using the installed WordPress. I learned how to set up a local development environment, deploy the local host WordPress website, and also how to fix the encountered problems during the installation.

   - [How to install WordPress on Mac M1 or M2 with XAMPP [2023, Fixed] 4K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ4YMxAFlz4)

   
## Estimated Hours
This time, I spent around 3.5 hours working on this practical.

## Content Insights
In this journey, the progress of installing XAMPP went well, but I encountered some problems during the creation of the WordPress account. At first, there was an error showing 'canâ€™t connect to database.' After creating the database, another error, 'unable to write wp-config.php file,' was discovered. However, the problems were solved after watching online materials.

In conclusion, I learned that before creating a new local WordPress website, we need to create a database first. The encountered problems, once solved, also deepened my understanding of developing a local host environment.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
In the previous weeks' practical, I learned how to create a website using the web server. This time, I developed a website on my device, which was hosted locally. This new way of creating a website helped me acquire more deep insights into learning CMS. I found out that the difference between local and web servers is that a database must be created for a local server.
