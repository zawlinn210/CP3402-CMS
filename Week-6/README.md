# Content Management System - CP3402 - Week 6 - Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
 - This week, I deployed a child theme with the parent theme 'Twenty-Twenty-Two' on the WordPress website I created last week. I studied how to set up and design the child theme. Additionally, I watched and learned from some online materials about child themes, which I believe might be useful for my upcoming group assignments.

## Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 3 hours working on and completing this practical.

## Content Insights
Throughout this journey, I encountered difficulties in the initial stage as the edited code in the child theme didn't affect the website. After watching videos and searching for information online, I was able to figure out the solution. Additionally, I utilized ChatGPT to help solve my problems.

Overall, there was a slight improvement in my website development and design skills. Solving the encountered problems also provided me with a deep understanding of deploying and designing websites. Creating a child theme before developing my own theme gave me a solid foundation.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Different from directly editing the website on the web server, this time I gained experience in editing the website on my local server. Editing the child theme provided me with a new experience that I had never had before. After completing the practical, I watched some online materials to further research child themes and gain insights that I didnâ€™t acquire during the practical. I believe what I gained from this experience is that utilizing a child theme helps web designers edit the website efficiently without affecting the main layout.
