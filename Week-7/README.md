 - For this practical, we have to write the PHP code for the website. I learned how to write PHP code by watching online resources, such as YouTube videos, which really gave me an understanding of how to write PHP code. This action helps me in completing our group assignment.

## Estimated Hours
I spent a total of 1.5 hours learning and writing the PHP code for this practical.

## Content Insights
Across the expedition, this was my first time learning PHP code, which I found very interesting. I encountered some minor problems at first due to no insight into PHP code. However, in the end, I understood how to write the code, just the basic one. The following code is what I learned from this practical:

- Echo – prints text or HTML for the website
- Decisions - if/else statements – use these statements to make decisions
- Repetition - for, while, foreach (use an array) – use these statements to repeat the code
- Functions - with parameters – this code can be used repeatedly 
- Include – allows users to use another file which also contains PHP code

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Along the way, I learned how to write PHP code, another way to create a website. The experience gained gave me deep insights into creating a website and also broadened my options for website development. Learning PHP code is fun, and I believe it will help me a lot in my group assignments as well as future assignments.

## Group Project Report
For the group assignment, we just did the basic code yet. The code is written with the combination of PHP and CSS language. We just started so the code is not done yet.
